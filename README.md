Finding the effectiveness of rubmel roadstrips using logistic regression and t-tests

Rumble strips are a road safety feature that alerts inattentive drivers of dangers either through vibration, noise or both. With successful placement, rumble strips may reduce the number of accidents. In this analysis, the dataset contained 1,988 Pennsylvanian roads that either were untreated or treated with rumble strips. Our analysis of the data concludes that although there were promising statistics like up to almost 60% reduction in accident rates with certain treated roads from 2008 to 2012, they were not statistically significant. We recommend more road data especially on treated roads and finer time points.
